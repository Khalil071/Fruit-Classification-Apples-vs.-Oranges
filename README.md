Fruit Classification: Apples vs. Oranges

Overview

This project focuses on classifying apples and oranges based on their weight and size using machine learning techniques.

Features

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and normalizing features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions.

Model Training & Evaluation:

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.

Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

Dataset

Contains weight and size features for apples and oranges.

Labeled as either Apple or Orange.

Installation

Install required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Usage

Run the script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results:

python classify_fruits.py

Results

Successfully classified apples and oranges with high accuracy.

Identified key features influencing classification.

Future Improvements

Test additional models like SVM and Neural Networks.

Expand dataset with more fruit types for multi-class classification.
